        <p>Hi, I'm a 26-year old web developer from San Diego, CA. Formerly a biotechnology engineer, I have
        recently made the transition into becoming a full-time web developer. My journey web dev began early in 2017
        when I stumbled upon an intro class at the local city college; since then, I began to develop an interest
        in web dev, as it served as the perfect platform for exercising the use of my creative and logical thinking.
        <p>Currently, am in the process of looking for full-time opportunities, as well as deploying more projects
        to showcase my aptitude as a developer.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, I like to spend time taking flattering photos of my friends, and methodically 
        learning new cooking techniques and recipes üç≥
