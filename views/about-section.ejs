    <article class='section__content'>
        <p>I enjoy creating modern, practical, and engaging websites and applications. My (growing!) skillset focuses on full-stack
            Javascript -- using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.</p>
        <p>When not busy with coding, I spend my time taking flattering photos of my friends, making my own bread, and keeping
            up with the latest news in distance running.</p>
        <p>Check out some of my work below. If anything catches your eye then Iâ€™d be happy to hear from you through the form
            below, or email me at:
